# Tomasulo
Simulation of Tomasulo Algorithm in C++ 

Based on the Tomasulo algorithm described in Computer Architecture - A Quantitative Approach (5e), Chapter 3. This simulation supports LD, SD, ADDD, MULTD, DIVD, and SUBD instructions. A very small memory unit was included for the purposes of specific examples I ran for LD/SD.
